- **Course Management**: Manage multiple courses with different credit hours
- **Automatic Calculations**: 
  - Individual assignment percentages
  - Category totals (homework, exams, quizzes)
  - Overall course percentages and letter grades
  - GPA calculation across all courses
- **What-If Calculator**: See how hypothetical grades would affect your course grade and GPA
- **User-Friendly CLI**: Interactive command-line interface for easy grade entry and viewing

## Grade Categories

The system supports three types of grades:

- **Homework**: Regular assignments and projects
- **Exam**: Midterms, finals, and major tests  
- **Quiz**: Short assessments and pop quizzes

## GPA Calculation

The system uses a standard 4.0 GPA scale:

| Letter Grade | Grade Points |
|-------------|-------------|
| A+ / A      | 4.0         |
| A-          | 3.7         |
| B+          | 3.3         |
| B           | 3.0         |
| B-          | 2.7         |
| C+          | 2.3         |
| C           | 2.0         |
| C-          | 1.7         |
| D+          | 1.3         |
| D           | 1.0         |
| D-          | 0.7         |
| F           | 0.0         |

GPA is calculated as: (Sum of grade points ร credit hours) รท Total credit hours

## What-If Calculator

The what-if calculator allows you to:
- See how a hypothetical assignment would affect your course percentage
- Understand the impact on your letter grade
- Calculate how it would change your overall GPA

The application includes comprehensive unit tests:

```bash
python test_grade_manager.py
```
